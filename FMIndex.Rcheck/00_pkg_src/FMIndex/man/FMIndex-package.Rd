\details{
The \code{FMIndex} package implements all the functions necessary to compute
the data structures of the FM index. The package has one main function
which computes all the FM index data structures and saves them into different
text files (the path is specified by the user):
\itemize{
\item F_col.txt for the F column (cont the occurrences of the unique
characters)
\item L_col.txt for the L column (BWT)
\item suffix_array.txt for the suffix array
\item tally_table.txt for the tally table
}
The functions that compute the FM index data structures are available: they
all take a DNAString as input and the return values are printed on the
console.

NOTE: to make the strings compatible with DNAString objects the termination
character used to build the BWT is "."
