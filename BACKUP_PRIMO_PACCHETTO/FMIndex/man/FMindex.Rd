\title{Writes the FM index}
\usage{
FMindex(fastafile, usrpath, tallywidth = 1, includeEndChar = TRUE)
}
\arguments{
\item{fastafile}{The .fasta file containing one single DNA sequence,
files containing multiple sequences are not allowed}

\item{usrpath}{The directory path where the user wants to save the files:
it must end with '/' (you can leave it empty if you want to save the files
in your working directory).}

\item{tallywidth}{How you want to compress the tally table. Default value=1}

\item{includeEndChar}{default value: true}
}
\value{
A list containint all the data structures necessary for the FM index
}
\description{
This function writes the FM index of the DNA sequence contained in the
.fasta file given in input
}
\details{
This function may raise an error if:
- The FASTA file provided contains more than one sequence
- The FASTA file provided contains no sequences
- The sequence of the FASTA file provided is empty
}
