# R PROJECT - FM index

 * Author: Sara Resta
 * Course: Scientific Programming
 * A.A.: 2022/2023
 * Professor: Rosario Michael Piro
 * Grade: 29/30  
   Comments:
    * Description on vignette not so clear without looking at code or manual;
    * Better use DNAString as input for the FMIndex function, the user can read the FASTA file manually
      (of maybe the user has already some data in memory, your solution would require the user to write it as a file before being able to use your function)
    * Perfect compilation and Bioconductor compliance!
